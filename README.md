## A2Z Insurance - Customer Segmentation

Work done for a university project, with other student.

## General Context

Finding new customers is vital in every industry. The process for finding new
customers begins by learning as much as possible from the existing customers.
Understanding current customers allow organizations to identify groups of
customers that have different product interests, different market
participation, or different response to marketing efforts. With this, we will
be able not only to serve better our customers, but also to improve the
targeting of prospective customers.

Market segmentation, the process of identifying customers’ groups, makes use
of geographic, demographic, psychographic, and behavioral characteristics of
customers. By understanding the differences between the different segments,
organizations can make better strategic choices about opportunities, product
definition, positioning, promotions, pricing, and target marketing.

## Business Situation

A2Z Insurance (A2Z) is a portuguese long standing insurance company that
serves a wide array of insurance services: Motor, Household, Health, Life and
Work Compensation. Although A2Z primarily serves portuguese customers, a
significant portion of their customer acquisition comes from their web site.
Customers can sign up to A2Z services through their branches, by telephone, or
on the web site.

In 2016, A2Z became one of the largest insurers in Portugal. However, the lack
of a data driven culture in the company ultimately led to poorly maintained
databases over the years. A2Z is trying to make better use of the database it
has regarding its customers. So far, it has simply mass-marketed everything.
All potential and existing customers get the same promotions, and there are no
attempts to identify target markets for cross-selling opportunities. Now, A2Z
wants start differentiating customers, and developing more focused programs.

A2Z provided you an ABT (Analytic Based Table) with data regarding a sample of
10.290 Customers from its active database. These are customers that had at
least one insurance service with the company at the time the dataset was
extracted. Your job is to segment the database and find the relevant clusters
of customers. To do this, we suggest you segment the customers using different
perspectives and approaches, as well as combine and analyze the results. A2Z
would like to understand the value and demographics of each customer segment,
as well as understand which types of insurance they will be more interested in
buying.

## Additional Information

1. May be considered as the first year as a customer
2. The current year of the database is 2016
3. No further information provided about the meaning of the area codes
4. Lifetime value = (annual profit from the customer) X (number of years that they are a customer) - (acquisition cost)

Notice the data was stored in a SAS database file. There may be some intricacies when
reading this file type using Python. Make sure the data is being
imported properly and that you remove (before or after converting it to a
pandas data frame) any irrelevant rows/columns you may find.

## Expected outcomes

1. Explore the data and identify the variables that should be used to segment customers.
2. Identify customer segments
3. Justify the number of clusters you chose (taking in consideration the business use as well).
4. Explain the clusters found.
5. Suggest business applications for the findings and define general marketing
   approaches for each cluster.

**Note:** Invest time into evaluating your preprocessing pipeling, thinking
how you want to do your clustering, possible approaches, and advantages or
disadvantages of different decisions.
